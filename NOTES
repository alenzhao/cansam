Doxygen tricks
==============

If you have a related function that needs to be a friend, and you want it to
appear in Related Functions rather than Friends (because that friendship is
not to be public knowledge), here are two options:

class foo {
public:
  // ...

  /** @relatesalso foo */
  friend void bar();

  // ...
};

/// Blah blah
void bar();

////////////////////

class foo {
  // ...

private:
  // ...

  // @cond private
  friend void bar();
  // @endcond

  //...
};

/// Blah blah
/** @relatesalso foo */
void bar();

Thus the options are:

* Put the friend decl with @relatesalso in the *non-private* part of the class
  (or wherever you like if EXTRACT_PRIVATE=YES), thus damaging encapsulation
  for people who read headers (though it makes no difference to the compiler,
  I like to put friend decls in the private section of classes, as that's the
  kind of information it is) and overconstraining the position in which bar()
  can appear in the documention.

* Or just punt and hide the friendship decl from doxygen.
