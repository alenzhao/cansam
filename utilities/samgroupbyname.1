.SH NAME
samgroupbyname \- order a SAM/BAM file so that read pairs are together
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR samgroupbyname " [" -bpv "] [" -o
.IR FILE "] [" FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B samgroupbyname
utility reads one file in SAM or BAM format, and writes it to standard output
(or a specified file) with its alignment records reordered so that records
with the same query name (i.e., paired reads) are adjacent.
If
.I FILE
is a single hyphen ("-") or is absent,
.B samgroupbyname
reads from standard input.
.P
If an
.B @HD
header is present, any
.B SO
tags are removed from it (as the output file is almost certainly no longer
fully sorted) and a
.B GO:query
field is added.
.P
It is assumed that, for each query name appearing in the input file, there are
no more than two alignment records with that query name.
Thus
.B samgroupbyname
can be used to group paired mates when each read in the pair appears only once.
If individual reads appear in more than one alignment record, for example,
if the file contains non-primary or split alignments, then these records and
their mate records will not be correctly grouped together.
.P
The following options are accepted:
.TP 5n
.B -b
Write output in BAM format.
By default, output is written as text in SAM format.
.TP
.BI "-o " FILE
Write to
.I FILE
rather than standard output.
.TP
.B -p
Emit paired reads only; any leftover singleton reads will be silently discarded.
By default, singleton reads are emitted en mass at the end of the output file.
.TP
.B -v
Display file information and statistics, on standard error.
.SH BUGS
Alignment records are held in memory until their mate is encountered.
If large numbers of reads and their mates are separated by vast numbers of
records in the input file,
.B samgroupbyname
will require vast amounts of memory.
Ideally it would use temporary files when necessary and a sensible amount
of memory, but this is not yet implemented.
.P
Fortunately this effect is usually sufficiently reduced for the common case
of input files sorted by location using the half-unmapped location trick
(i.e., giving unmapped reads their mapped mate's location).
.P
Occurrences of more than two alignment records with the same query name do not
produce a diagnostic.
