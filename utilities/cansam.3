.SH DESCRIPTION
The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) file format and its binary companion BAM
are formats for storing nucleotide sequence alignments.  They are designed
for the large volumes of short- to middling-length reads produced by
next-generation sequencing technologies.
.P
.B Cansam
is a C++ library providing classes representing the records found in
these files, facilities for reading and writing SAM and BAM files, and several
algorithms for manipulating these files, including sorting and merging.
.P
Several simple command-line utilities using these facilities are also provided.
