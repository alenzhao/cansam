* Utilities for alignment records:
  - bam_cigar2qlen
  - bam_reg2bin
  - bam_tpos2qpos (given pos on the reference, figure out which base in
    the read corresponds to it by parsing the cigar; just became private
    to bam_maqcns.c)
  - done, actually:
      - bam_calend (is right_pos()/right_zpos())

* Extra header sam/samfwd.h or so that declares all our classes

* Move any information in REFCOUNT and UNCOUNTED into lib/alignment.cpp

* Reorder the variable-length fields in memory, swapping READ_NAME and CIGAR,
  so that CIGAR is naturally-aligned.

* Maybe refcount the alignments so that assignment is cheap too, and you
  don't need to obfuscate with swap() -- EXCEPT it wreaks havoc with threading

* Indexing
  - Constructing and loading indices
  - Utility function for (sensible!) parsing of "chr2:100,000-200,000"
  - Some form of iterator equivalent to bam_fetch()

* Randomly select a subset of reads (samtools-help, "Subsetting BAM, at random")

* C++ infrastructure
  - Make it work with -fno-implicit-templates

* Documentation
  - Doxygen HTML filename overachieving: build the filename myself by hacking
    on util.cpp's convertNameToFile() and/or filename.cpp's generateDiskNames()

* Utilities:
  - samgroupbyname: add -m or so that populates R2/Q2/etc (samtools-help,
    "Fill R2 and Q2 tags")

* Things that samtools does that we don't:
  - Pileups
