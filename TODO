* Utilities for alignment records:
  - bam_cigar2qlen
  - bam_reg2bin
  - bam_tpos2qpos (given pos on the reference, figure out which base in
    the read corresponds to it by parsing the cigar; just became private
    to bam_maqcns.c)
  - done, actually:
      - bam_calend (is right_pos()/right_zpos())

* Move any information in REFCOUNT and UNCOUNTED into lib/alignment.cpp

* Maybe refcount the alignments so that assignment is cheap too, and you
  don't need to obfuscate with swap() -- EXCEPT it wreaks havoc with threading

* Indexing
  - Constructing and loading indices
  - Utility function for (sensible!) parsing of "chr2:100,000-200,000"
  - Some form of iterator equivalent to bam_fetch()

* C++ infrastructure
  - Possibly worthwhile specialising std::iterator_traits for our home-grown
    iterator classes

* Documentation
  - Doxygen HTML filename overachieving: build the filename myself by hacking
    on util.cpp's convertNameToFile() and/or filename.cpp's generateDiskNames()

* Things that samtools does that we don't:
  - Pileups
